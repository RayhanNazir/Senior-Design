### **Tasks Assigned to Ethan (Computer Vision Focus):**

1. **Research** computer vision libraries (e.g., OpenCV) to identify the best tools for bird species identification.  
2. **Design** the algorithm for processing live bird images captured by the feeder’s camera.  
3. **Develop** a bird species recognition system using machine learning or predefined image datasets.  
4. **Test** the accuracy of the bird identification system with sample data to validate performance.  
5. **Integrate** the computer vision system with the feeder’s camera module, ensuring real-time data capture.  
6. **Refine** the species identification algorithm to improve accuracy based on user feedback and data analysis.  
7. **Document** the computer vision pipeline, including any pre-processing steps and algorithms used.  
8. **Create** a prototype of the system to test real-time bird identification in a live environment.

### **Tasks Assigned to Rayhan(Database and Data Management Focus):**

1. **Research** about SQL databases and how to incorporate them into our bird identification system  
2. **Investigate** existing databases that contain information about different bird species to use as our reference for our data comparison model   
3. **Develop** algorithm that will analyze the data collected on the bird through our bird identification program and compare to the reference database  
4. **Design** our own database that will organize and store the data that we collect for each bird  
5. **Refine** database model to increase accuracy and efficiency based on results collected by the bird identification program  
6. **Document** database structure that outlines where specific data is stored and relationships between tables.

### **Joint Tasks (Collaboration):**

1. **Specify** the requirements for the smart bird feeder hardware, including the camera, sensors, and Mirco.  
2. **Investigate** various hardware components and choose the best options for the camera and sensors based on budget and performance.  
3. **Develop** the overall user interface, allowing users to access bird data and set preferences.  
4. **Test** the complete system (camera, computer vision, database) to ensure all components work together effectively.  
5. **Validate** the system through user testing, gathering feedback on usability, and identifying potential improvements.
