# Smart Bird Feeder - Senior Design Project

For my senior design project, I’m working on a **smart bird feeder** that uses **computer vision** to capture live bird data and provide useful information about the birds to the user. This project combines the areas of computer vision and data processing, which are fields I’ve developed a strong interest in throughout my time in college. 

I’m working with a partner who has a more in-depth background in **database management**, so we’ll be combining our skills to store and analyze the bird data collected by the feeder. From my side, the focus will be on building the computer vision system to identify different bird species, while my partner will manage how the data is stored and presented to users. This project will give me the chance to apply everything I’ve learned in class and from my co-op experience in a real-world application.

## Academic Background

My academic background in **Computer Science** has laid a strong foundation for this project. Courses like **Artificial Intelligence (CS4033)** helped me develop a deep understanding of problem-solving and **machine learning** concepts, both of which are crucial for the computer vision aspect of the bird feeder. These classes pushed me to think critically about how algorithms can be applied to process large amounts of data, which I expect will be a big part of this project. 

Additionally, **Database Design (CS4092)** introduced me to database design and how data can be efficiently stored and retrieved, which is something I’ll be working on with my partner. Through these courses, I’ve not only gained technical skills but also learned how to approach complex problems methodically, which will be key as we design and troubleshoot the bird feeder.

## Co-op Experience

My previous **co-op experiences** have also played a huge role in preparing me for this project. During my first semester, I worked as a **software intern at Prodigy**, where I was introduced to **hardware** and **embedded systems programming**, which was new to me as a computer science major. This gave me confidence working with hardware, which will be necessary for setting up the sensors and cameras on the feeder. 

In my second semester, I worked on a **text recognition project** using computer vision. This experience is one of the main reasons I chose to incorporate computer vision into my senior design project because I really enjoyed working on it and wanted to explore it further. I also learned how to work independently and troubleshoot issues on my own during this time, which will be important as I expect there will be challenges in getting the bird feeder to work as planned.

## Project Motivation

I’m really motivated to take on this project because I enjoyed working with **computer vision** during my co-op, and I like the idea of creating something that combines **technology with nature**. The idea of building a system that can track and recognize birds in real-time is exciting because it feels like a practical use of computer vision that could actually be useful. 

For now, my approach is to start by using a computer vision library like **OpenCV** to handle the image processing and identification of bird species. My partner and I will also work on setting up a **database system** to store all the data the feeder collects. My preliminary approach is to use a **Raspberry Pi** with a camera and sensors to build the feeder, which will allow us to automate data collection.

## Expected Accomplishments

In terms of what I expect to accomplish, my goal is to create a **functional smart bird feeder** that accurately identifies birds and gives users easy access to data about the birds that visit. I’ll know I’ve done a good job when the system can reliably identify different bird species and store that information in a way that’s easy to access and analyze.

I’ll be setting small milestones throughout the project, like:
- Successfully setting up the hardware
- Getting the computer vision system to work
- Building the database

If I can get everything working as planned and feel confident that I’ve contributed to each part of the project, I’ll consider it a success.
