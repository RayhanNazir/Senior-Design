Deliverables: A database with tables for storing bird data. Documentation of the database schema and APIs used to store and retrieve data.

**Milestone 5: Hardware Setup and Camera Integration**  
Description: Start putting together the hardware for the smart bird feeder, including the camera, sensors, and processing unit. Integrate the camera with a Raspberry Pi or other processing hardware.  
Deliverables: A working hardware setup with the camera and sensors properly installed and ready to capture bird images. Documentation of the hardware assembly and camera configuration.

**Milestone 6: User Interface Design and Development**  
Description: Develop a user-friendly interface for users to view real-time data, historical trends, and reports. The interface will allow users to configure notification preferences and access the database.  
Deliverables: A working user interface, accessible via web or mobile, that displays bird data and allows for user interaction. Documentation of the UI layout, design choices, and functionality.

**Milestone 7: System Integration and Testing**  
Description: Integrate all pieces of the system (camera, computer vision, database, user interface) and test the overall functionality of the smart bird feeder.  
Deliverables: A fully integrated system capable of capturing bird images, identifying species, storing data in the database, and displaying it to the user. Test reports detailing system performance, bug fixes, and user feedback.

**Milestone 8: Refinement and Optimization**  
Description: Fix issues found in initial testing, refine the system to improve accuracy, and user experience. Optimize the bird identification algorithm and database queries.  
Deliverables: An optimized and refined version of the smart bird feeder system with improvements in accuracy and user interface responsiveness. Updated documentation for both the technical system and user manual.

**Milestone 9: Final Presentation and Documentation**  
Description: Prepare the final project presentation, demonstrating the functionality of the smart bird feeder. Complete all documentation, including technical reports, user manuals, and project reflections.  
Deliverables: A comprehensive final report and presentation, including the projectâ€™s design, development process, and final outcomes. All source code, documentation, and user manuals will be submitted.
