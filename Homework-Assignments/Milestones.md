## Milestone 4: Computer Vision System Development (Spring Semester)
- **Description**:  
  Design and implement the bird identification algorithm using computer vision techniques. This milestone focuses on processing images and identifying bird species.  
- **Deliverables**:  
  - A functional prototype of the bird identification system, capable of processing test images and recognizing a set of bird species  
  - A report detailing the algorithm, tools used, and initial accuracy tests  

---

## Milestone 5: Database Design and Implementation (Spring Semester)
- **Description**:  
  Design the database structure to store bird identification data, timestamps, and sensor readings. Develop the database and implement data storage processes.  
- **Deliverables**:  
  - A database with tables for storing bird data  
  - Documentation of the database schema and APIs used to store and retrieve data  

---

## Milestone 6: User Interface Design and Development (Spring Semester)
- **Description**:  
  Develop a user-friendly interface for users to view real-time data, historical trends, and reports. The interface will allow users to configure notification preferences and access the database.  
- **Deliverables**:  
  - A working user interface, accessible via web or mobile, that displays bird data and allows for user interaction  
  - Documentation of the UI layout, design choices, and functionality  

---

## Milestone 7: Refinement and Optimization (Spring Semester)
